4 Ways to start a thread
1. Create a class and extends Thread (Abstraction), override the run method (Polymorphism),
create and instantiate the Thread object and call its method .start()
to execute the program

2. Create a class and implements Runnable (Can be abstraction), override the run method (Polymorphism),
create and instantiate the Thread object, wrap the Runnable object, and call its method .start()
The Runnable interface is preferred over the Thread class for creating threads in Java 12.
This is because the Runnable interface provides a cleaner separation between your code and
the implementation of threads, making your code more flexible 1.

When you extend the Thread class, you are modifying the threadâ€™s behavior, which can lead to conflicts
when you add more features inside your class 1. On the other hand, when you implement the Runnable interface,
you are simply giving the thread something to run, which means composition is the better way to go 1.

3. Anonymous implementation of Runnable by creating a Runnable object, override the run method (Polymorphism),
create and instantiate the Thread object, wrap the Runnable object, and call its method .start()

4. Lambda implementation of Runnable syntax: Runnable runnable = () -> {};
